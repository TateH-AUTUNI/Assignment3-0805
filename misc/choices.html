  <h1>Choices</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Options for mitigating the threat of cyberterrorism</h2>
  <div class="sr"></div>
  <h3>1. Making sure systems are up to date</h3>
  <div class="sr"></div>
  <p>The most common vulnerability in any system is out of date software and security patches so up to date software is top priority in any situation</p>
  <br>
  <h3>2. Strengthening infrastructure</h3>
  <div class="sr"></div>
  <p>After we have that first layer of security with up to date software we can help mitigate more threats through the use of external security systems and better hardware to mitigate hardware vulnerabilites</p>
  <br>
  <h3>3. Using cyber-safety knowledge</h3>
  <div class="sr"></div>
  <p>The end users cyber-safety knowledge also needs to be taken into consideration, with the chance to teach people who arent the most safe online and while using tech the basics of cybersecurity.</p>
  <div class="sr"></div>
  <p>using strong passwords - BUT making sure that you’re not using the same password for every website. Using strong passwords and multiple different passwords go hand in hand - not having one of these two points compromises one’s safety online. If one has a strong password, but someone figures it out, and that person has the same password across all the websites they use, that compromises their safety. If one does not have a strong password but uses different passwords for each website, it is still not ideal as the passwords would be easy to figure out, though it may provide a slightly increased layer of security. If one does not have a strong password and uses it across all websites then they are extremely vulnerable to cyber-attacks. </p>
  <div class="sr"></div>
  <p>not opening suspicious files - This was alluded to when talking about phishing/ransomware. If the file is sent through email, check the actual email and see if it is a legitimate email or not. If the file is sent through texting, then check if the number matches up with the company they’re trying to be. With both of these, check if the grammar that the email/text has is accurate - in most cases, the grammar is all over the place. </p>
  <div class="sr"></div>
  <p>Don’t leak passwords anywhere. Even if you tell one person, it’s still a problem. You don’t know for sure what they would do with it (if they tell you they may be lying) - so don’t take that risks, keep your passwords safe.  </p>
