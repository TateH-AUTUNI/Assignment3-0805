  <h1>Ethical Issues</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Loss of life - Especially so in the medical industry, as important information may be lost as a result of cyber-attacks.</p>
  <p>Violations of human rights - especially not allowing people’s information to be private.</p>
  <li>According to United Nations’ Declaration of Human Rights, section 12 - “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.”</li>
  <li>Privacy is a right that we have all access to. By attacking an organisation, stealing their data and their patients’ data, it is a direct violation of the Declaration of Human Rights</li>
  <br>
  <p>Exploitation of vulnerabilities - in the systems that the organisations use. This was especially shown in the Waikato Hospital cyber-attack,</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Team Ethical Considerations</h3>
  <p>Alex - “I definitely think cyberterrorism/cybercrime in general is something that people should pay more attention to in regards to it being a threat. We’re growing day by day in the technology sector but for some reason a lot of us are still not aware of what it means to be safe online. For some, a simple cyber-attack may turn their life upside down, for the wrong reasons. This is why people need to be vigilant when going online - and making sure that the things they’re receiving in emails/texts aren’t going to place them in a horrible situation."</p>
  <p>Tate - "Cyberterrorism is something that people will have to think of daily as people interract with a more and more connected world, especially with techlological progresses in medicine and in ai everyone will need to be more vigilant as it becomes more prevalent, with it affecting everyones health and wellbeing when it strikes"</p>
  <p>David - ""</p>
