  <h1>Risks</h1>
<br>
  <h3>Cyberterrorism has some serious risks. Here’s a few:</h3>
<br>
<p>The Internet is the worldwide connection of LANs and WANs. By connecting to the internet, one can access a magnitude of information, from all across the world. This is also the case for cyber-attacks. Because we’re all connected to the internet, it’s possible for cyber-attacks to come from anywhere in the world. So it is a definite possibility that the cyber-attacks that were done on Waikato Hospital and Pinnacle were not done from New Zealand. </p>
<br><br>
<p>The developments in technology over the years mean more of a risk for cyberterrorism to occur.</p>
<li>It’s no secret that we’ve come a long way in our technology development. Starting out with making tools many many years ago, now we’re making computers that connect us to the world. But it’s also no secret that this new technology we’re making can be very much compromised by cyber-attacks</li>
<br><br>
<p>Different types of cyber-attacks are also evolving as a result of developing technology. So in a few years, we may see variations of current types of cyber-attacks, and entirely new types.</p>
<li>We will of course be expecting different attacks. What we won’t be expecting is how these attacks will take place - that’s something we can only figure out from seeing these attacks.</li>
<li>These new attacks may be very hard to stop and hence can be a bigger problem than what we have now. They may vary in range of effectiveness - some may be instantly damaging to the system, others may grow over time, others may just be plain annoying to deal with but aren’t too much of an issue. </li>
<li>The cyber terrorists can and will become aware of these new attacks. Then they can use these attacks to commit acts of terrorism, spread their message and become a source of power</li>
