    <!-- Main Body -->
  <p>According to Google, the definition of cyberterrorism is the use of the Internet to conduct violent acts that result in or threaten the loss of life or significant bodily harm. Due to the rise of technology, devices are becoming more and more integrated into our lives - nowadays everything is done through computers, smartphones, etc. But with this rise in technology comes a rise in cyberterrorism.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>In the medical industry, cyberterrorism is a massive threat to people’s safety, possibly the biggest threat. If one gains access to the systems of a hospital or other medical centre with malicious intent, then it can definitely lead to significant bodily harm and loss of life - if the doctor has no idea what to do with the patient because the medical records are missing, then there is a chance for massive mistakes to be made. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Cyberterrorism is achieved through cyber-attacks. Here are some examples: <br>
     <li>DoS (Denial of Service) - Designed to shut down a network making it inaccessible to the authorised users</li> 
     <li>Ransomware - software that is designed to encrypt files on a device, preventing users from seeing them, and the hacker can ask for a ransom to give the files back. Is a form of malware (malicious software)</li>
     <li>Phishing - taking information from others (could be through ransomware)</li>
     <li>Data breaches - when information is taken from an organisation without the organisation’s approval, and can be released publicly</li>
    </p>
  <br>
  <p>One example of a cyber-attack in the medical industry is the Waikato Hospital ransomware attack, in May 2021. They were susceptible to cyber-attacks because five percent of their system was running out of date software (Windows 7), but that five percent was enough to bring Waikato Hospital down. This resulted in private information being leaked, patients needing to be transferred, and surgeries postponed. This is an example of a ransomware attack. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Also in New Zealand, Pinnacle Health was targeted by a cyber-attack through a third-party server, in September 2022. Around 500,000 people are patients with Pinnacle, and the people in the Waikato/Taranaki/Rotorua area were affected. Though these systems were more secure than that of Waikato Hospital, the attack resulted in private information of Pinnacle’s patients being stolen and posted online, and according to cyber experts, the information is enough that people can carry out identity fraud. This is an example of a data breach.
