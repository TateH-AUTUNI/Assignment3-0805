    <!-- Main Body -->
  <p>According to Google, the definition of cyberterrorism is the use of the Internet to conduct violent acts that result in or threaten the loss of life or significant bodily harm. Due to the rise of technology, devices are becoming more and more integrated into our lives - nowadays everything is done through computers, smartphones, etc. But with this rise in technology comes a rise in cyberterrorism.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>In the medical industry, cyberterrorism is a massive threat to people’s safety, possibly the biggest threat. If one gains access to the systems of a hospital or other medical centre with malicious intent, then it can definitely lead to significant bodily harm and loss of life - if the doctor has no idea what to do with the patient because the medical records are missing, then there is a chance for massive mistakes to be made. For example, wrong prescriptions could be made (too much/too little of something, or wrong supplement altogether), and staff would not be notified about certain patients’ needs. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Why is this important to society?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Organised terrorism groups have lots of resources available to them. Here’s why they would be interested in cyberterrorism:</p>
  <br>
  <li>According to Dorothy Denning (Cyberterrorism - How real is the threat?), “cyberterrorism and cyber-attacks are sexy right now” </li>
  <li>Cheaper than traditional terrorist methods. The terrorist would need a computer and a connection to the internet. Normal methods involve a lot more than that. </li>
  <li>Once the terrorist gets on the internet the amount of targets there are for them to attack is unthinkable. More people start using the internet day by day, and it won’t be hard to take people’s information</li>
  <li>When people create accounts online, they can pretend whoever they want to be - there is no rule that enforces people to create accounts based off their official name. So it makes it hard for the average person to track who did it - the terrorists’ identity will be safe</li>

  <br>
  <h2>Cyberterrorism is achieved through cyber-attacks. Here are some examples:</h2> <br>
     <h3>DoS (Denial of Service) - Designed to shut down a network making it inaccessible to the authorised users</h3>
     <br>
     <li>DoS take many forms, ultimately preventing authorised people from using a service by consuming system resources</li>
     <li>Major risk because they interrupt communication and cause loss of significant time and money, and are easy to conduct</li>
     <li>These are very difficult to eliminate, hence why people tend to do those attacks, like the notable DoS attack by MafiaBoy in 2000, on HP and other similar websites, denying people access to the websites. And he was only fifteen at the time. </li>
     <li>DDoS is similar to DoS but originates from multiple, coordinated sources. Threat actor may build a network of infected hosts - zombies - known as a botnet. Uses command and control program to instruct the botnet</li>
  <br>
    <h3>Ransomware - software that is designed to encrypt files on a device, preventing users from seeing them, and the hacker asks for a ransom to give the files back. Is a form of malware (malicious software). Types of malware include: </h3>
    <br>
    <li>Viruses - Type of malware that propagates by inserting a copy of itself into, and becoming part of, another program. Spreads from one computer to another. Only stays in the device unless the person decides to share file with someone else</li>
    <li>Worms - Similar to viruses and causes same type of damage, they do not require a host program or human help to propagate. </li>
    <li>Trojan Horse - is a type of malware that downloads onto a computer disguised as a legitimate program. For example, sketchy emails, posing to be a legitimate company, but if the user clicks the link then this will result in computers being critically compromised </li>
  <br>
  <h4>Types of ransomware include:</h4>
    <li>Locker ransomware - in the name - locks people out of their devices.</li>
    <li>Crypto ransomware - encrypts people’s files. According to wired.com, “encrypting files means that no one else will be able to make sense of the data on there unless a decryption password is known, in most cases is a password only known to you”. This is good however when this power is placed in the wrong hands, then you won’t be able to make sense of your own files.</li>
    <li>Double extortion ransomware - encrypts + exports users’ files.</li>
    <li>Ransomware as a service - a place where people can rent ransomware, but the threat actors would not get the whole ransom - a percentage of it is paid to the developers. </li>
  <br>
  <h3>Phishing - attempting to take information from someone by getting that someone to reveal personal information</h3>
<br>
  <li>This is similar to the Trojan Horse ransomware attack in the way that one can pose to be a legitimate company, and request certain information from the target for their system</li>
  <li>The threat actors pretend to be trustworthy businesses, work colleagues or even friends. </li>
  <li>This threat can be avoided if you’re cyber-smart, but if you’re not cyber-smart, you may fall into the threat actor’s trap easily, and they would be able to take your personal details</li>
  <li>An organisation I know of recently has encountered these points - threat actors pretended to be the CEO of the organisation, and sent an email to a very junior employee (who had been there for one or two days), asking for that employee to buy gift vouchers for the staff. They had done their research because they knew one of the other employees who was not on the organisations’ website and knew that said employee was the junior employee’s boss. She bought them not knowing it wasn’t the CEO who had sent that email. Credit card details were given to the threat actors as a result. However it is unknown whether more money had been spent on the card.</li>
  <br>
  <h3>Data breaches - when information is taken from an organisation without the organisation’s approval, and can be released publicly, compromising the safety of the organisations whose information was released. </h3>
  <br><h4>According to CERT NZ, Information that is released in most cases is: </h4>
  <li>identifying one/multiple people</li>
  <li>health records </li>
  <li>intellectual property</li>
  <li>embarrassing information to harm people or organizations.</li>
  <p>Data breaches and phishing go hand in hand - a phishing attack leads to a data breach. And as alluded to before, the Trojan horse malware attack is similar to phishing. This makes all of these attacks (ransomware, phishing, data breaches) basically a domino effect - and these attacks will be very hard to fix if they do happen.</p>
  <br>
  
  <h3>Examples of cyber-attacks in the medical industry</h3>
  <br>
  <p>One example of a cyber-attack in the medical industry is the Waikato Hospital ransomware attack, in May 2021. They were susceptible to cyber-attacks because five percent of their system was running out of date software (Windows 7), but that five percent was enough to bring Waikato Hospital down. This resulted in private information being leaked, patients needing to be transferred, and surgeries postponed. This is an example of a ransomware attack. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Also in New Zealand, Pinnacle Health was targeted by a cyber-attack through a third-party server, in September 2022. Around 500,000 people are patients with Pinnacle, and the people in the Waikato/Taranaki/Rotorua area were affected. Though these systems were more secure than that of Waikato Hospital, the attack resulted in private information of Pinnacle’s patients being stolen and posted online, and according to cyber experts, the information is enough that people can carry out identity fraud. This is an example of a data breach.
